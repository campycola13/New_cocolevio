an AI system that automatically extracts predefined key terms from legal contracts

h4. *So that*

our legal and procurement teams can quickly review, compare, and manage contractual obligations without manual reading and tagging.

----

h3. *Description*

Contracts often contain essential legal and operational terms such as the names of involved parties, contract duration, and specific clauses (e.g., confidentiality). Manually reviewing each contract to locate these terms is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent across reviewers. This feature will leverage AI/NLP to automatically identify and extract key contract terms from various contract formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) and present them in a structured format for review or integration into contract management systems.

----

h3. *Key Terms to Extract* (Initial Scope):

* First Party (e.g., ""Company A"")
* Second Party (e.g., ""Vendor B"")
* Contract Start Date
* Contract End Date
* Confidentiality Clause (presence and text)
* Termination Clause (presence and summary)
* Payment Terms
* Jurisdiction/Governing Law
* Renewal Terms

----

h3. *Definition of Done*

* The system can process uploaded contracts in PDF and DOCX formats.
* Key terms listed above are correctly extracted from at least 90% of test contracts.
* Extracted terms are displayed in a user-friendly dashboard or exported in JSON format.
* The output includes a confidence score for each extracted term.
* The system is tested with at least 100 diverse contract samples.
* QA and Legal teams have validated the extracted terms for accuracy and completeness.

----

h3. *Acceptance Criteria*

# *File Upload Functionality*
#* Given a contract in PDF or DOCX format,
When it is uploaded into the system,
Then the contract content is parsed and displayed in a structured format.
# *Key Term Identification*
#* Given a parsed contract,
When the AI processes it,
Then each predefined key term is extracted and labeled with ≥90% accuracy.
# *Confidence Score Availability*
#* Given the extracted terms,
When results are presented,
Then each term includes a confidence score (e.g., 0.95 for ""Contract Start Date"").
# *User Review Panel*
#* Given extracted terms,
When viewed by a user,
Then they can confirm, correct, or reject extractions manually.
# *Edge Case Handling*
#* Given non-standard contract language or missing sections,
When processed,

* Follow up questions asked according to previous response and question eg. After first query, next follow up query could be ""Give examples"".
* Prompt can include the history-text of conversation.

I want the QA system to save the full history of question-response pairs within a conversation session so that I can ask follow-up questions in context. Follow-up queries (e.g., “Give examples”) should be understood in relation to the preceding conversation. The prompt used to query the LLM can optionally include prior conversation history to maintain contextual awareness across turns.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

*  Every user query and system response is saved in chronological order within a session object.
* History is persistently stored with timestamps and session ID.
* Follow-up questions are resolved in context using previous Q&A pairs.
* Prompt used to query the model includes prior conversation (at least last N turns) to support follow-up understanding.
* API or backend logic supports retrieval of session history for UI display or prompt generation.

*Definition of Done:*

*  Conversation history structure (e.g., in DB or memory) is implemented and integrated with QA pipeline.
* Prompt construction logic includes history for contextual follow-ups.
* Functional tests validate proper handling of follow-up queries.
* UI displays conversation in sequential format (chat view).

* Save uploaded documents as embeddings and save documents' name as meta data so when chunks are extracted, documents name can be shown in 'SOURCE'.
* QASystem is already implemented, but needs testing if giving accurate responses of query from All uploaded documents. 
* No prompt is added to yet, it might be required as per quality of current responses.

The QA system is to retrieve accurate answers from all uploaded documents and display the document name as the source to verify the origin of the information being presented. The uploaded documents should be embedded and stored with their filenames as metadata, allowing the system to attach a 'SOURCE' field for each retrieved chunk. Need thorough testing for response accuracy across all uploaded documents. No prompt engineering has been applied yet; it may be introduced based on QA quality.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* - All uploaded documents are saved as vector embeddings using LangChain-compatible format-
* -Filenames are saved as metadata during the embedding phase.-
* -QA system retrieves from multiple documents and attaches the correct document name as 'SOURCE' in the response.-
* -Functional test verifies responses include accurate and relevant content from all uploaded sources.-
* A fallback prompt enhancement is documented if responses are found lacking in relevance or completeness.

*Definition of Done:*

* - Documents are embedded and stored with metadata.-
* -QA system retrieves from all documents.-
* -Output includes accurate citations using document name.-
* Unit and integration tests written and passed.

LEVI-1604,23172,Story,Levi,Arun Kumar Saxena,P1,Raghav Singh,David Merrit,30-06-2025 00:00,"Zero Trust is a cybersecurity framework based on the principle of ""never trust, always verify."" It assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network and requires strict identity verification and access control at every stage. By default, no user, device, or application is trusted, even if they are inside the network perimeter.

We will apply the Zero Trust framework into all of our products going forward. Please look into applying this and utilizing CSCC to help with the endeavor. 

h3. Core Principles of Zero Trust

# *Verify Explicitly*: Authenticate and authorize users and devices based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, and workload identity.
# *Least Privilege Access*: Limit access permissions to only what is necessary for a user or device to perform their role or function.
# *Assume Breach*: Design systems with the assumption that an attacker has already breached your network, implementing logging, monitoring, and alerting.

h3. Applying Zero Trust to  Cocolevio Products

Since our platform deals with sensitive client data, AI features, and integrates with external APIs, Zero Trust principles are essential to safeguard our system. Here’s how to implement Zero Trust across various layers:

# *Identity and Access Management*

* *Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*: Require MFA for all users, especially Super Admins and Admins.
* *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)*: Ensure access permissions are tied strictly to roles (Super Admin, Admin, HR, etc.) and limited to the data and actions needed for their responsibilities.
* *Identity Providers (IdP)*: Integrate with secure IdPs (e.g., Azure AD, Okta) for centralized identity management and single sign-on (SSO).

# *Endpoint Security*

* *Device Trust*: Require device compliance checks before granting access. This ensures that only approved, secure devices connect to the system.
* *IP Whitelisting and Geo-Restrictions*: Restrict access to your web application from certain IPs or geographic regions.

# *Network Security*

* *Segmentation*: Use network segmentation to isolate critical components like your on-premises database from other application layers.
* *Secure Connections*: Ensure all communication between our AWS-based database uses encryption.
* *Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)*: Replace or supplement VPNs with ZTNA solutions to provide secure, granular access.

# *Data Protection*

* *Encryption*: Encrypt all sensitive data both at rest (PostgreSQL, local IndexedDB/SQLite) and in transit.
* *Data Masking*: Implement dynamic data masking for roles with read-only access, like Readers, to reduce data exposure risks.
* *Access Logs and Audits*: Monitor who accesses sensitive documents or APIs and from where.

# *Application Security*

* *Token-Based Authentication*: Secure API endpoints with OAuth 2.0, API keys, or JWTs.
* *Rate Limiting and Throttling*: Protect APIs from abuse by implementing rate limits.
* *Input Validation*: Ensure all data inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
* *Zero Trust for AI Features*: Prevent external LLMs from accessing vectorized document embeddings directly. Use private models or secure API calls.

# *Monitoring and Threat Detection*

* *Logging*: Implement centralized logging for user activities, API calls, and system events.
* *Anomaly Detection*: Use AI-based tools to detect unusual behavior patterns that might indicate a breach.
* *Regular Security Reviews*: Conduct penetration testing and regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

# *Automation*

* *Policy Enforcement*: Use automated tools to enforce Zero Trust policies (e.g., deny access if MFA is not enabled or a device is out of compliance).
* *Automated Responses*: Integrate security information and event management (SIEM) or CocolevioHR Security Control Center tools to trigger automated responses to threats, such as revoking access or isolating compromised systems.",69892.21660105571,300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Done,25-04-2025 15:36,,,26-05-2025 00:00

*Audio Input:* VoiceStream handles the real-time transcription as it already does

*Whisper AI Integration*: The Whisper AI Correction component passes the initial transcription to Whisper AI for semantic and contextual correction.

*Optional Audio Stream for Whisper A:* Whisper AI receives the raw audio stream to improve the accuracy of its corrections with direct audio-processing.

*Real-Time Updates:* The corrected transcription is displayed in real time. Include synchronization to ensure user-facing updates are seamless.

*Feedback and Logging:* Store raw and corrected transcripts for analysis.

*Acceptance Criteria*:

# *Authentication Setup*:
#* Successfully authenticate with the Greenhouse Harvest API using the provided API key.
#* Ensure that requests include the required {{Authorization}} header ({{Basic base64_encoded_api_key}}).
#* Implement a secure storage mechanism for the API key.
# *API Call Functionality*:
#* Perform at least one GET request to fetch data (e.g., list of candidates or job openings).
#* Log the API responses and errors for debugging and traceability.
# *Error Handling*:
#* Handle cases where authentication fails (e.g., invalid key, expired token).
#* Gracefully handle other potential HTTP errors (e.g., 400, 404, 500).
# *Code Quality*:
#* Write modular and reusable functions for making API requests.
#* Ensure the codebase adheres to existing linting and formatting standards.



# *Research and Setup*:
#* Read the [Greenhouse API documentation|https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html#authentication].
#* Generate and securely store the Greenhouse API key.
# *Authentication Implementation*:
#* Write a method to authenticate with the Greenhouse Harvest API.
#* Verify the connection using a simple test endpoint (e.g., {{/users}}).
# *Perform API Calls*:
#* Implement functionality for making authorized GET requests.
#* Example: Fetch a list of jobs ({{GET /jobs}}).
# *Error Handling*:
#* Implement error-handling mechanisms for common HTTP status codes.
#* Log errors and failed API calls for debugging purposes.
# *Testing*:
#* Write unit tests for authentication and API request functions.
#* Test API calls with various scenarios (e.g., valid/invalid key, network failure).
# *Documentation*:
#* Document the setup process for connecting to Greenhouse API in the project’s README or Confluence.
#* Include examples of API calls and expected responses.",86400,16200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Done,28-11-2024 18:48,,,07-06-2025 00:00

*HTTP Interceptor for API Call Errors*:

* The Interceptor can log all HTTP errors that occur during API calls to the Flask backend.

*Handling Dropped Connections*:

* Capture dropped connections and network errors through HTTP interceptors, where you can retry or log these issues.



*Frontend Task To perform :* {color:#ffc400}*3-4 days*{color}

* Handles logging to console and backend
* Captures all uncaught errors.

# [~accountid:638075d73c26ca7fa0d2e2f6] to add another point.
## The issue was observed in resume parsing for the sample Digital Marketing Analyst job post. 
### In the job post, the *Required Skill Set* included _SEO_ as one of the skills.
### In the uploaded resume, _Search Engine Optimization_ was listed in the candidate’s skills.
### The issue here is that _Search Engine Optimization_ is listed under *Not Matched Skills Evaluation*, even though SEO is its abbreviation.
### In addition, _SEO_ is listed under *Matched Skills Evaluation* and it seems to be extracted as a keyword from the different skills mentioned in the resume. 
### For instance, the candidate listed _WordPress SEO_ and _Shopify SEO_ in their resume. The resume parsing process moved the “SEO” part of the phrase under matched skills, leaving only “WordPress” and “Shopify” under the Not Matched category. The changes the meaning of what the candidate had mentioned in their resume.
### Individual words also appear to be extracted only once, leading to similar issues in the resume parsing. For example, the phrase _Brand Strategy_ was extracted first from the resume. This changed _Social Content Strategy_(from the resume) to _Social Content_ (in LEVI report).
### Refer to the screenshot for reference. On the left is the skill set from the resume and on the right is the Resume Report from LEVI.

* Convert speech to text with transcription.
* Compare textual content to benchmarks for rating.
* Leverage text scoring models.
* Tune thresholds and criteria weighting for accuracy.

 

Guide: [How to evaluate a summarization task | OpenAI Cookbook|https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/evaluation/how_to_eval_abstractive_summarization]

 

Develop the rating rubrics for criteria like vocabulary, coherence, and technical detail on a 1-5 scale

* Use Whisper data for speech-to-text to get transcript of audio response.
* Define rating criteria and scales (ex: vocabulary 1-5 stars)
* Create benchmark dataset 
* Use GPT-4 to score new transcripts:

Python example:

* Leverage Whisper for transcription
* GPT-4 text generation for predicted ratings
* Fine tune on expert benchmarks
* Weighted combination of criteria scores
* Set score thresholds for pass/fail assessment

Vocabulary:

* Use of Python syntax terms and concepts 
* Scale: 1-5
* 1 = No Python terms
* 3 = Basic terms like variable, function, list
* 5 = Fluent use of broader terms like OOP, decorators, iterators

Explanation Coherence:

* How clearly Python concepts are explained
* Scale: 1-5
* 1 = Disjointed, hard to follow
* 3 = Moderately clear explanation
* 5 = Very clear, easy to understand

Technical Detail:

* Inclusion of key Python concepts needed to show understanding
* Scale: 1-5 
* 1 = Missing all key Python details
* 3 = Some relevant details like data types or modules
* 5 = Details like classes, scopes, imports to show deeper knowledge

The 1-5 rating scales help assess the degree of knowledge and calibrate scores across different respondents.",57600,343800,,,,,,,LEVI-430,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,In Progress,19-03-2024 14:10,,,23-06-2025 00:00

Just a follow up – I tried adding Priya as a User this morning, and she is not showing up in the user list nor did she receive any invitation.

I created a new account, but David mentioned that it might be because of the changes implemented. Just wanted to make you aware this occurred.{color}
* *Testing as an Admin:*
** {color:#ff991f}The changes to the text options for the Job Posting look great.{color}
** {color:#36b37e}The evaluation stages have been updated on the Applicant Details page, but have not been updated on the Applicant Dashboard where the Evaluation Stage can be filtered.{color}

 

* {color:#ff5630}When adding a new role, can we add an option for “No Access” in the permissions options? {color}
* {color:#ff5630}Also, is there a need for the My Profile field? {color} 

* {color:#ff5630}I completed the assessment as a user and when I reviewed the results on the admin side, there was not a video displayed, just the placeholder.{color}



* Testing as a user:
** The email invitation looks better, but I’ve attached suggested verbiage and the screenshot of what it looks like. It still comes off looking a little unsafe.
** It doesn’t look like we’re asking for permission for access to their microphone/camera once they make it to the assessment screen. There’s a pop up but it is on the screen for a very short amount of time and I can’t fully read it.
** I tested the assessment without audio and the previous error has been corrected. The pop up thanking the candidate displayed.
